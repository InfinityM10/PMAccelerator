# Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
This project analyzes weather data to uncover temperature trends, air quality correlations, and geographical variability. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and climate pattern analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing data.
2. **EDA**: Exploring temperature distribution, correlation between features, and geographical patterns.
3. **Forecasting**: Using ARIMA, Random Forest, and XGBoost models for predicting temperature.
4. **Advanced Analyses**: Anomaly detection and geographical heatmap creation.

## Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
    gh repo clone InfinityM10/PMAccelerator
    ```
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `weather.ipynb` for the complete analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook weather.ipynb
    ```

## Results
- Detailed analysis and visualizations can be found in the `results` folder.
- Forecasts and model evaluations are provided in the `weather.ipynb` notebook.

## Future Work
- Integrating more granular weather data for better predictions.
- Expanding geographical analysis to include more regions.
